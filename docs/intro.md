# Intro

Chazos is a headless framework built on Laravel, TailwindCSS and Alpine JS. It allows you to create tables, set permissions and consume data using a rest API in no time.

## What does it contains

The framework contains things such as table builder, data viewer, plugin manager, auth, permissions and last but least settings

### 1. Table Builder
Its a simple builder that allows to create tables, add/remove/edit columns, edit the tables and remove them, if you dont like them.

It is from this sections that you can set permissions to prevent prying eyes from viewing your lovely data. 

**You dont need to write API calls because thats already done for you**
### 2. Data Viewer
As the same says this section allows you to view data in all your tables. You can also export and import data. This means in the event that you no longer like this framework, the door is open. No pay me this much to get outüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### 3. Plugin Manager
Plugins allow you to extend the functionality of a framework without touching its core code. The plugin manager allows you to install and unistall plugins. 

For more info on how to write plugins please go to the plugins sections.
### 4. Payment System
You can recieve payments using Chazos.

### 6. Other things
